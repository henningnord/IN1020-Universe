# IN1020-Universe ðŸŒŒ

## Summer Internship Project â€“ 2025

This project was developed as part of my summer internship at the University of Oslo (UiO) in 2025. It is a digital learning platform designed for IN1020: Introduction to Computer Science, a first-year course at the Department of Informatics (IFI).

The platform presents a variety of interactive tasks, both single-player and multiplayerâ€”that are intended to be solved individually or in groups. It also features an integrated AI-powered chatbot to support students by answering questions about the course content.
